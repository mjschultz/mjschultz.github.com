A few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a> came to Washington University to give a talk to drum up interest in a new idea he is working on (<a href="http://fleet.cs.berkeley.edu/docs/07.Jul.2009-slides.pdf">Fleet, Infinity &amp; Marina</a> [PDF slideshow]).Â  In my experience, most "old guy" talks aren't that interesting because they meander with long tangential stories about their children.Â  Luckily, those were kept to a minimum and he had a good sense of humor too!

Now---interesting as the talk was---he suggested everyone read his only non-technical paper titled, "<a href="http://research.sun.com/techrep/Perspectives/smli_ps-1.pdf">Technology and Courage</a>" [PDF from Sun].Â  It took me until yesterday to read it, but it was certainly an interesting article.Â  I recommend everyone read it.
