title: Technology and Courage
---
A few weeks ago, [Ivan
Sutherland](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland) came to
Washington University to give a talk to drum up interest in a new idea he
is working on ([Fleet, Infinity &
Marina](http://fleet.cs.berkeley.edu/docs/07.Jul.2009-slides.pdf) [PDF
slideshow]). In my experience, most "old guy" talks aren't that interesting
because they meander with long tangential stories about their children.
Luckily, those were kept to a minimum and he had a good sense of humor too!

Now---interesting as the talk was---he suggested everyone read his only
non-technical paper titled, "[Technology and
Courage](http://research.sun.com/techrep/Perspectives/smli_ps-1.pdf)" [PDF
from Sun]. It took me until yesterday to read it, but it was certainly an
interesting article. I recommend everyone read it.
