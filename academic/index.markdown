## Academic ##

I am working towards a *philosophi&aelig; doctor* in [Computer
Science](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in Saint
Louis](http://www.wustl.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Patrick
Crowley](http://arl.wustl.edu/~pcrowley/).
Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer
science from [Marquette University](http://www.mu.edu/).
After which I took an opportunity to work with [Dr. Dennis
Brylow](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/), as a research assistant for the
[Systems Laboratory](http://xinu.mscs.mu.edu/), during which time I
received my Master of Science in Computer Science.
If you are interested you can view a listing of [all the courses](courses)
I have taken through my academic career.
You can also download my [curriculum vit&aelig;](static/vitae.pdf) as a
PDF, though it should largely mirror the contents of this page.

### Teaching ###

My office is located in [Bryan
Hall](http://eit.engineering.wustl.edu/map/map.asp), [Room
419](http://eit.engineering.wustl.edu/map/Bryan/floor4.gif).
I will have dedicated office hours Tuesday from 3pm-4pm and Friday 3pm-4pm
this semester.
Otherwise, feel free to stop by to see if I'm around or send an email if
you wish to meet (though I make no guarantees on availability).

### Research ###

#### Research at Washington University ####

I am currently a research assistant for Dr. Patrick Crowley at Washington
University in Saint Louis.  As such, I have effectively become a member of
the [Applied Research Lab](http://arl.wustl.edu/) (ARL), which
largely deals with network infrastructure and dealing with high-speed
network tasks.

At present, my specific research is developing a ``Passive Network
Appliance'' (PNA) that allows network administrators to closely monitor
network traffic while providing line-speed (or near line-speed) detection
of malicious content.

#### Research at Marquette ####

As a graduate student, I was offered a research assistantship to work in
the systems laboratory under [Dr. Dennis
Brylow](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/).
The lab is largely focused around projects using [Embedded
Xinu](http://xinu.mscs.mu.edu/)&mdash;a small, stable, easy-to-use
operating system.

This laboratory concentrates on embedded, real-time, and interrupt-driven
systems.
My master's thesis focuses on exploring how software transactional memory
(STM) will work in an interrupt-driven system.
In theory, by using STM we would be able to reduce jitter in the handling
of interrupt since global structures would be lock-free.

Another goal of Embedded Xinu is to present a simple to understand O/S for
teaching undergraduate and graduate students about operating system
concepts.
Having been taught operating systems by implementing various parts of Xinu,
I believe this is useful as pedagogical tool.
As such, one of the constant goals is to keep Xinu easy to understand.

### Side Projects ###

At Marquette I, and others, helped [Dr. Craig
Struble](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~cstruble/) develop and build
``[slayer](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~cstruble/slayer/).'' This system is a
small (sixteen core) beowulf cluster computer.  Photos are available on Dr.
Struble's web site.

Additionally, I was an active member of Marquette's [Linux Users
Group](http://mulug.mscs.mu.edu/) and [Student ACM
Chapter](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~acm/).
I also took on (and still perform as) the role of system administrator for
the Linux Users Group server.
