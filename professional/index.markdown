## Professional ##

Though my focus is generally [academic](academic), I also believe in having
a firm grasp on practical matters (i.e., the clich√©d "practice what you
preach"). As such I have a mixture of work experiences and side projects.

### Work Experience ###

* Senior Engineer at [Observable Networks, Inc.](https://www.observable.net)

  Design, develop, and analyze algorithms to detect anamolous behavior
  using network traffic meta-data. Maintain a stable technical operations
  environment. Interact with customers to train and acquire feedback for
  both the usefulness of our algorithms and the user experience on the web
  site.

* Developer and Director of Student Media Interactive, College of
  Communication at Marquette University.

  Led a team of four student developers and designers to create, maintain,
  and improve the web presence for the student media outlets (newpaper,
  television, radio, journal, and advertising).

### Side Projects ###

My [GitHub page](https://github.com/mjschultz) has solid information about
the repositories I maintain and my contributions to free and open source
software. A few of the projects I am particularly proud of are included
below.

* [yum-multithread](https://github.com/mjschultz/yum-multithread), my
  first open source plugin. Designed as a plugin to the YUM package manager
  to allow packages to be downloaded in parallel. It has since been
  deprecated by support built into YUM/DNF.
* [boot.xinu-os.org](https://github.com/xinu-os/boot.xinu-os.org), a web
  site designed to allow users to boot the [Embedded Xinu](http://xinu-os.org/)
  kernel in their browser. I did not write the emulator but the goal is to
  allow learners to download, modify, compile, and boot their kernel with
  only their laptop (and time).
